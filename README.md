# Automated Grid Congestion, Voltage Violation & Curtailment Screening Tool for Alberta Transmission Network

## Project Overview

The aim of the project is to to build an automated **Python–PSS®E framework** for performing large-scale steady-state reliability analysis of the **Southeast Alberta transmission network**.

With increasing integration of **renewable energy resources (wind and solar)**, power systems face operational challenges such as **thermal congestion, voltage violations, and generation curtailment requirements**.

This project performs **8760-hour AC power flow simulations** using hourly generation profiles to evaluate network constraints and determine the required curtailment needed to maintain reliable system operation.


## Key Features

- **8760-Hour Automated Simulation**
  - Hourly AC power flow simulation for a full year.

- **N-0 / N-1 Contingency Analysis**
  - Detects system violations under normal and contingency conditions.

- **Automated Congestion Relief (ACCOR)**
  - Automatically calculates generation curtailment required to resolve overloads.

- **Data-Driven Grid Insights**
  - Congestion ranking of transmission elements
  - Voltage violation heatmaps
  - Curtailment logs
