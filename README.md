# Automated 8760-Hour Steady-State Reliability & Curtailment Assessment

## Overview
This project, developed for **ENEL 678**, implements an automated **Python–PSS®E framework** to perform large-scale steady-state reliability assessments of the **Southeast Alberta transmission grid**.

With increasing integration of **renewable energy resources (wind and solar)**, modern power systems face operational challenges such as **thermal congestion** and **voltage stability risks**.

This project performs **8760-hour AC power-flow simulations** using hourly generation profiles to identify network bottlenecks and evaluate the curtailment required to maintain reliable grid operation.

## Key Features

- **8760-Hour Automation**  
  Automated hourly simulation loop using AESO generation profiles.

- **N-0 / N-1 Contingency Analysis**  
  Detects transmission bottlenecks and reliability violations.

- **Automated Congestion Relief (ACCOR)**  
  Calculates required generation curtailment to resolve overloads.

- **Data-Driven Insights**  
  Generates congestion rankings and voltage violation heatmaps.
